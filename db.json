          "a": "a] ^αἰῶνας^: I rather expected to find ^κόσμους^ here instead of ^αἰῶνας^. It is the only place where ^ποιεῖν^ and ^αἰών^ occur together. In fact, as the object of God’s creation, ^αἰών^ is used only one other time, in Heb. 11:3: ^Πίστει νοοῦμεν κατηρτίσθαι τοὺς αἰῶνας ῥήματι Θεοῦ, εἰς τὸ μὴ ἐκ φαινομένων τὸ βλεπόμενον γεγονέναι^. Which is to say, this is an interesting way for the author to describes God’s creative activity. Etymology is Indo-European (IE) ^*h2ei-u^, which became ancient Greek ^αἰϝων^, and ultimately Greek ^αἰών^. This is one instance in where the digamma doesn’t leave a trace in the classical Greek form. It is possible to posit the digamma because of the Latin cognate aevus (Etymological Dictionary of Greek, EDG). (To understand the “^h#^” in the IE roots, see n## on the Laryngeal Theory.)",
          "b": "b] ^ἀπαύγασμα^: ^ἀπό-αὔγασμα^, ultimately from ^ἀυγή^ “light, glow, ray of light”, likely from IE ^h2eug-^ “shine” or “increase, grow strong” (EDG). The ^ἀπό^ prefix simply means “out” or “forth”, and therefore we get “shine forth. ^‘-μα’^ is a Greek suffix used to denote the result or effect of an action. (Sm 841.2); for example, the verb ^νοέω^ “to think”, gives us the noun νόημα “thought”. ^αὔγασμα^ is a verbal noun deriving from ^αὐγάζω^ “to shine upon”. Therefore, an ^ἀπαύγασμα^ is the result of the action of being shined upon. The word is only used once in the GNT, and once in the Wisdom of Salomon. The ^-μα^ suffix is more appropriately ^*μν^̥̥, for which, see n11-12.",
          "c": "c] A note on word frequencies: Seeing how often a word is used by a particular author or in a particular corpus can be illuminating. For example, ^ἀπαύγασμα^ is only used once. This could mean the author wanted to use a particularly poetic or obscure word, maybe for the purpose of punctuated his declaration. But there are problems. First of all, we don’t have all the words that were written by the early Christian leaders, so it could be that a word that only appears once or twice, could have had much greater representation in other works. Further, just because a word is used infrequently in writing doesn’t necessarily mean that it should be regarded as special. If I use the word macabre only once in my corpus of journal entries, that could just be because that was the first word to came to mind, or I could have just heard it used by somebody else; it doesn’t mean that I wanted a special term to be used. So, I will have occasion to refer to the frequency of a word, but note that this practice isn’t without caveats.",
          "d": "d] ^δοξής^: I think it is possible to disregard the word histories and subtleties of meaning for the majority of words in the scriptures—at least as they relate to our daily practice of religion. For example, whatever the lexica tell us about the word ^ὄνομα^: isn’t going to effect how I view God or my religious obligations. But there are some words that are much more vital in our devotion, and ^δόξα^ has to be one of those words. John 17:3 reads that to obtain eternal life one must know God and Jesus Christ, and ^δόξα^ is quiet possibly the quintessence of what sets them apart. Furthermore, biblical and extra-biblical verses promise the believer participation in this ^δόξα^ here and hereafter. *I recommend reading the entry in Kittel for this one. There are 20 pages devoted to the word, and they are plenty compelling. I will do my best to summarize them here. ^δόξα^ is derived from the verb ^δοκέω^ “I think”, which itself is a deverbative from ^δέκομαι^. The complex etymology can be found in EDG s.v. ^δοκέω^ and ^δέχομαι^. In non-biblical Greek, the meaning “I think” is conveyed in the noun ^δόξα^ as both “the opinion which I have” and “the opinion which others have of me.”  It was an important word in Greek philosophy and Greek culture generally. Culturally it was reputation and renown, and unqualified ^δόξα^ was the pinnacle of achievement for an individual.",
          "e": "e] ^χαρακτήρ^: This is the origin of the English word “character.” It comes from the verb ^χαράσσω^, which means “to make pointed, sharpen; to carve, engrave, strike, stamp.” (RB s.v.) It first occurs in Hesiod (very old) and is thought to be a Pre-Greek word. From the idea of engraving, comes the idea of the engraved thing. The idea of a “physical of language idiosyncrasy” and “individual feature, style, character” is attaches to the word in the Hellenistic era. ",
          "f": "f] ^μεγαλωσύνης^: another word of fairly low frequency. It occurs three times—twice in the epistle to the Hebrews, and once in Jude. Nothing too remarkable here. The ^-συνη^ ending is a productive suffix, typically found in abstract words. It is properly the feminine of the adjectival ending ^-συνος^. I wondered if perchance the ending could be parsed and discoverable as a grammaticalization (see n11). I wonder if it is not a compound of two suffixes, namely ^-σι-^ and ^-να-^. ^-σι-^ is equal to ^-τι-^, but is found after vowels (Sm 840.a.1-2, 115). Both suffixes are productive for names of actions and abstract substantives (Sm 840). ^Nu^ is the constant in the suffix ^-να-^, which is manifest with many other vowels before and after (Sm 861.11, 858.11), and it is used in the creation of adjectives. So maybe we begin with SI to create a abstract like ‘righteousness’ and then append NA to create the adjective ‘righteous’. The compound ending eventually gets reanalyzed/re-appropriated as a single unit productive of nouns like ^μεγαλωσύνη^ and ^δικαιοσύνη^. But what of the the two suffixes themselves? The principle of grammaticalization says that grammatical elements are often generated from other lexical categories, such as nouns and verbs and whatnot (See n9. Smyth says 'the origin of the Greek suffixes is often obscure; of those inherited from the parent language only some were employed to make new words; others were formed by Greek itself (productive suffixes). From the analogy of modern languages we infer that some of the suffixes were once independent words, which , on becoming part of a compound, lost their significance (Sm 833).'  With ^-σι-^ actually coming from ^-τι-^, I wonder if its origin is not neuter the indefinite pronoun ^τις/τι^. It’s not a great strain to envision the creation of an abstract noun from a root and an indefinite pronoun—but this might all be very reckless linguistics."

          "aa": "aa] What is the purpose of the chapter? Why was the author given to write and publish it? For me this question is more obvious because it is a chapter I would not have written. It’s not vital to know the author’s intention to consume or even profit from a text, and an audience can have an experience of a text that is different and maybe even contrary to the purposes of the author, but nevertheless, I think divining the mind of the author can be productive. Was the text to have a supernatural function, like a sort of mantra that causes something cosmic for the reader (or writer)? Was it meant to appeal to the heart or to the head? Am I supposed to feel something in reading this. or am I supposed to think something when reading?",
          "bb": "16] spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets: XXX It is similar to the parable of the steward that occurs in XXX. The master sent a number of emissaries without success, so he at last sends his son, hoping they will respect his authority. So maybe one idea here is that the sundry messengers of the past have been trump by the declarations of the son. We are to listen to him as one with greater authority and as one with a less diluted message. It reminds me of a passage in Salinger’s Franny and Zooey: “I can’t see why anybody — unless he was a child, or an angel, or a lucky simpleton like the pilgrim — would even want to say a prayer to a Jesus who was the least bit different from the way he looks and sounds in the New Testament. My God! He’s only the most intelligent man in the Bible, that’s all! Who isn’t he head and shoulders over? Who? Both Testaments are full of pundits, prophets, disciples, favorite sons, Solomons, Isaiahs, Davids, Pauls — but, my God, who besides Jesus really knew which end was up? Nobody. Not Moses. Don’t tell me Moses. He was a nice man, and he kept in beautiful touch with his God, and all that — but that’s exactly the point. He had to keep in touch. Jesus realized there is no separation from God. “ There is a similar encomium to Jesus in Shaw’s preface to Androcles and the Lion. It is hard to pick out the best quote from that preface, but I will leave one and encourage the reader to turn to the whole preface himself: “When the Protestants translated the Bible into the vernacular and let it loose among the people, they did an extremely dangerous thing, as the mischief which followed proves; but they incidentally let loose the sayings of Jesus in open competition with the sayings of Paul and Koheleth and David and Solomon and the authors of Job and the Pentateuch; and, as we have seen, Jesus seems to be the winning name… And it may be that though nineteen centuries have passed since Jesus was born… and though his Church has not yet been founded nor his political system tried, the bankruptcy of all the other systems when audited by our vital statistics, which give us a final test for all political systems, is driving us hard into accepting him, not as a scapegoat, but as one who was much less of a fool in practical matters than we have hitherto all thought him (93).”"
