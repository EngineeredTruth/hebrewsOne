<p class="wtf-text">
I have undertaken to write a commentary on the first chapter of the <span>Epistle to the Hebrews,</span> found in the New Testament. I will be drawing from the <span>Greek text.</span> </br>

I have selected this text in this language because it allows me to explore each of my intellectual amores: <span>religion, philosophy, psychology, and linguistics.</span></br>

The comments are informal, and at times will properly have nothing to do with the text. The text will simply be a means of sparking some reflection or inspiration however fitting or obscure–maybe a bit like a Rorschach test, or just free-association. For example: in verse 4, the author uses the word όνομα; on seeing that word I felt to reflect upon the syllabic nu in Greek, and also on the epenthetic tau that creeps into words of this class. That doesn’t make a particle of difference in the exegesis of the text, but I comment nonetheless.</br>

Although it does not relate directly to the interpretation of the text, I do believe a commentary of this sort can add to its enjoyment. A heavily linguistic approach can make stagnant words become vibrant as they are exposed in all their Indo-European complexity and beauty. It’s like getting that new Patagonia soft shell and tracing the genesis of each fabric to its Asian provenance–the jacket is nice, but exploring its creation can be fascinating too.</br>

This project is foremost a chance at play for me. Just as I’ll scramble in the Flatirons or play pick-up ball, intellectual adventures are a joyous resort. Secondarily, I think it could function as a manual for those interested in learning Greek. Throughout my commentary I will make references to Greek grammars and Indo-European resources, helping the student of Greek to become familiar with these tools for their work with the language.</br>

A fair-bit of my notes have been and will be composed during breaks and downtime while working my rotation at Trinity Expanded Shale and Clay, making this one of the first commentaries of its kind to be written on the premises of a construction materials mine.</br>

Apologies in advance for any mistakes. I value precision in these endeavors, but I can’t ensure that I’ll live up to that standard.</br>
